# Ansible Auto Control Hub Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature MUST implement deny-by-default security model. All access requires explicit authorization through RBAC. No privileged containers or escalated permissions without documented justification and approval. Secrets management MUST prevent plaintext keys and sensitive credentials from entering conversation logs, audit trails, or any persistent storage in unencrypted form.

**Rationale**: Enterprise automation platforms handle critical infrastructure and sensitive data, requiring defense-in-depth security posture from design to deployment. Secrets leaking into logs or conversations create significant security vulnerabilities.

### II. Plan-Apply Review
All infrastructure changes MUST follow plan → review → apply workflow. No direct production modifications without peer review of execution plan. Automated systems MUST generate and present plan artifacts before execution approval.

**Rationale**: Infrastructure automation requires human oversight for critical changes to prevent cascading failures and ensure accountability.

### III. Human-Machine Auditability
Every action MUST generate complete audit logs accessible to both humans and automated systems. All events require structured logging with correlation IDs. Audit trails MUST survive system failures and provide forensic investigation capabilities.

**Rationale**: Enterprise compliance and troubleshooting require comprehensive traceability of all automation decisions and actions.

### IV. Test Coverage ≥70% (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Unit test coverage MUST maintain minimum 70% threshold with quality metrics. Tests written before implementation using TDD methodology. Coverage gates MUST block deployment of undertested code.

**Rationale**: High-quality automation requires extensive testing to prevent infrastructure failures and maintain system reliability.

### V. Schema-First Design (Interface Contract First)
All APIs MUST define OpenAPI/JSON Schema contracts before implementation. Frontend and backend development proceeds from shared schema contracts. Breaking changes require versioning and migration paths. No implementation work begins until interface contracts are reviewed and approved.

**Rationale**: Contract-first development ensures interface consistency, enables parallel development with clear expectations, and prevents integration issues through upfront agreement on data structures and protocols.

## Security Requirements

All components MUST implement:
- RBAC with principle of least privilege
- Secrets management with encrypted storage and rotation capabilities
- Container security without privileged mode or unnecessary capabilities
- Network security with explicit firewall rules and encrypted communication
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Secure defaults for all configuration options

Authentication and authorization MUST be enforced at every system boundary with appropriate session management and token validation.

## Quality Gates

Development workflow MUST enforce:
- **CI Validation**: Frontend and backend builds with automated testing
- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and security scanning on all commits
- **Test Requirements**: Unit tests ≥70%, integration tests for critical paths
- **Review Process**: Peer review required for all production changes
- **Documentation**: API documentation auto-generated from schemas

## User Experience

### VI. Dual Interface Equivalence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
GUI and natural language interfaces MUST provide equivalent functionality and user experience. No feature exclusivity between interaction modes. Both paths MUST maintain same security posture and audit capabilities.

**Rationale**: Different users prefer different interaction modes; feature parity ensures consistent user experience and prevents workflow lock-in.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and architectural decisions. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles.

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional changes require:
1. Formal proposal with impact assessment
2. Stakeholder review and approval
3. Version increment following semantic versioning
4. Migration plan for existing systems
5. Update of all dependent templates and documentation

**Compliance Review**: Monthly constitution compliance audits required with remediation plans for violations. Use README.md and project documentation for runtime development guidance.

**Enforcement**: Constitution violations MUST be documented with explicit justification in complexity tracking tables within implementation plans.
