# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP-Controlled Docker Compose Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Validation Summary**: 
- Specification focuses on deployment automation value without implementation details
- All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable with specific time limits and success indicators
- User scenarios provide complete coverage: core deployment (P1), health/rollback (P2), cross-distribution (P3)
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure scenarios and boundary conditions
- Configuration variables are clearly defined with defaults
- No clarification markers remain - all requirements are clear and actionable

**Key Deliverables Defined**:
- ansible.cfg with YAML callback and log_path enabled
- requirements.yml with community.docker collection
- playbooks/deploy_compose.yml with sync, build, up, health check, and rollback
- runbook.md and pipeline.md documentation

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage**:
- ✅ Syntax validation (--syntax-check)
- ✅ Service health verification (docker compose ps)
- ✅ HTTP endpoint verification (curl with 30s timeout)
- ✅ Idempotency validation (zero changes on second run)
- ✅ Rollback mechanism (compose down or image revert)
