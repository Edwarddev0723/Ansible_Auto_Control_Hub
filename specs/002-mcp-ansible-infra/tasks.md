# Tasks: MCP-Controlled Docker Compose Deployment

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-mcp-ansible-infra/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is infrastructure automation requiring validation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Infrastructure automation project: `ansible_projects/infra_owner_deploy/` at repository root
- Source files: `Infra_owner_demo/` directory
- Documentation: `docs/` directory
- Paths shown below use ansible_projects structure from plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create ansible project directory structure: `ansible_projects/infra_owner_deploy/` with subdirectories: `playbooks/`, `roles/`, `inventory/`, `group_vars/`, `logs/`
- [ ] T002 [P] Create ansible.cfg with YAML callback, log_path enabled in `ansible_projects/infra_owner_deploy/ansible.cfg`
- [ ] T003 [P] Create requirements.yml with community.docker collection specification in `ansible_projects/infra_owner_deploy/requirements.yml`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Automated Docker Compose Deployment (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Core deployment workflow that installs Docker, synchronizes files, builds and runs containers

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Health Verification and Rollback (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Automated health checks with retry logic and automatic rollback on failures

**Independent Test**: Simulate deployment failure, verify health checks detect it and rollback executes successfully

### Tests for User Story 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T030 [P] [US2] Create health check validation test to verify docker compose ps output format

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - deployment succeeds with health verification, failures trigger rollback

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Documentation (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Integration (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories + documentation
- **Risk Mitigation (Phase 8)**: Can proceed in parallel with implementation, finalize after integration

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 playbook but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 docker_setup role but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (validation tasks) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Role implementations can proceed in parallel where marked [P]
- Main playbook orchestration comes after role implementations
- Validation and execution come after playbook creation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002, T003, T005, T006, T007)
- All Foundational role directory creation tasks can run in parallel (T011, T012, T013, T014)
- Within User Story 1: File copy tasks can run in parallel (T020, T021, T022, T023)
- Within User Story 2: Health check implementations can run in parallel (T032, T033)
- Documentation tasks can run in parallel (T049, T050, T051, T052)
- Risk mitigation documentation tasks can run in parallel (T063, T064, T065, T066, T067)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all file sync tasks together (T020-T023):
Task: "Implement frontend directory synchronization in roles/app_sync/tasks/main.yml"
Task: "Implement docker-compose.yaml copy with rename in roles/app_sync/tasks/main.yml"
Task: "Implement Dockerfile copy in roles/app_sync/tasks/main.yml"
Task: "Implement nginx.conf copy in roles/app_sync/tasks/main.yml"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T014) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T015-T029)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! - Basic deployment works)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Health checks + rollback added)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Cross-platform support added)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T015-T029)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T030-T040) - can start writing health_check role
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T041-T048) - can start OS detection enhancements
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent operations, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach for infrastructure validation)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---
