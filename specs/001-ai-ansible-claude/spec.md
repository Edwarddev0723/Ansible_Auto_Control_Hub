# Feature Specification: AI-Driven Ansible Automation Control Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-ansible-claude`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "AI 驅動的 Ansible 自動化控制與可視化操作平台。兩種操作：① Claude+MCP 自然語言→Ansible Playbook/CLI；② Web GUI 表單→FastAPI→Ansible/ansible-runner。功能：/run_playbook、/check_status、審計日誌、SSH inventory（本機/遠端）。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Natural Language Ansible Operations (Priority: P1)

DevOps engineers and system administrators can describe infrastructure automation tasks in natural language, and the system automatically translates these into executable Ansible playbooks and commands, then executes them with full audit tracking.

**Why this priority**: This represents the core AI-driven value proposition, enabling non-expert users to perform complex automation tasks through conversational interfaces, significantly reducing the learning curve for Ansible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a natural language instruction like "install nginx on web servers" and verifying that the system generates appropriate Ansible commands, executes them, and provides results with audit logs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has SSH access to target servers, **When** they describe "install docker on all production servers", **Then** the system generates appropriate Ansible playbook, requests approval, executes, and shows results
2. **Given** existing inventory configuration, **When** user requests "check status of nginx service on web tier", **Then** system executes ansible ad-hoc commands and displays service status with timestamps
3. **Given** a failed task execution, **When** user asks "why did the last deployment fail", **Then** system analyzes logs and provides diagnostic information in natural language

### User Story 2 - Visual Playbook Management (Priority: P2)

Operations teams can use a web-based graphical interface to create, manage, and execute Ansible playbooks through forms and visual controls, providing equivalent functionality to the natural language interface but with structured input validation.

**Why this priority**: Provides a familiar GUI alternative for users who prefer visual interfaces, ensures feature parity between interaction modes as required by constitution, and enables complex multi-parameter operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new playbook through web forms, configuring parameters, executing it, and monitoring progress through the visual dashboard.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** web interface access, **When** user creates a new deployment playbook using form fields, **Then** system validates inputs, generates playbook, and enables execution with progress tracking
2. **Given** existing playbooks in the system, **When** user selects and configures parameters via GUI, **Then** system executes with same security and audit capabilities as natural language interface
3. **Given** active playbook execution, **When** user views dashboard, **Then** system displays real-time progress, task status, and allows intervention actions

---

### User Story 3 - Infrastructure Status Monitoring (Priority: P3)

System administrators can monitor the current state of their infrastructure through automated status checks, with both real-time dashboards and on-demand queries across their entire server inventory.

**Why this priority**: Provides operational visibility and monitoring capabilities essential for maintaining infrastructure health, complements the execution features with observability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring inventory, running status checks across multiple servers, and verifying that results are accurate and properly displayed in both interfaces.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** configured server inventory, **When** user requests infrastructure status check, **Then** system polls all servers and displays comprehensive health dashboard
2. **Given** mixed local and remote servers, **When** automated status monitoring runs, **Then** system successfully connects to all endpoints and reports connectivity and service status
3. **Given** status monitoring data, **When** user queries specific metrics, **Then** system provides detailed breakdowns and historical trends

### Edge Cases

- What happens when SSH connectivity to target servers is lost during playbook execution?
- How does system handle conflicting natural language interpretations (e.g., ambiguous server references)?
- What occurs when playbook execution fails midway through multi-task operations?
- How does system manage concurrent executions from multiple users on same infrastructure?
- What happens when inventory contains servers with different SSH configurations or credentials?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide natural language processing interface that converts user descriptions into executable Ansible commands and playbooks
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide web-based GUI with form-driven playbook creation and execution capabilities
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure functional equivalence between natural language and GUI interfaces for all core operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST execute `/run_playbook` operations with real-time progress tracking and result reporting
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide `/check_status` functionality for infrastructure health monitoring across inventory
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain comprehensive audit logs for all operations with timestamps, user identification, and execution details
- **FR-007**: System MUST support SSH inventory management for both local and remote server configurations
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement security controls preventing unauthorized access to servers and sensitive operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide real-time feedback during playbook execution with ability to monitor progress
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle execution errors gracefully with detailed error reporting and recovery suggestions
- **FR-011**: System MUST support concurrent operations while preventing conflicts on same infrastructure resources
- **FR-012**: System MUST authenticate and authorize users before allowing access to automation functions

### Key Entities

- **Playbook**: Represents an Ansible playbook with metadata, parameters, execution history, and audit trail
- **Inventory**: Server and group definitions with connection details, tags, and status information
- **Execution**: Individual playbook or task execution instance with status, logs, results, and timing data
- **User Session**: User authentication session with permissions, preferences, and activity history
- **Audit Entry**: Comprehensive log record of all system operations with user, timestamp, action, and outcome details

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully execute common infrastructure tasks through natural language descriptions within 30 seconds from request to execution start
- **SC-002**: Web GUI interface provides equivalent functionality to natural language interface with 100% feature parity for core operations
- **SC-003**: System maintains 99.9% uptime for both interfaces during normal operations
- **SC-004**: Audit logging captures 100% of user operations with complete traceability and forensic capabilities
- **SC-005**: System successfully connects to and manages at least 100 servers simultaneously across local and remote inventory
